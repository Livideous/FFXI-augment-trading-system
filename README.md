This is a glorified reconstruction of a trade system concept based on a snippet from an old DPS forums topic from over a decade ago. I've been using it for about 5 years now in a project I never got running until recently. This is the culmination of a week worth of time over those 5 years.

I'm starting to back up all my content so I figured I'd start sharing my work in case anyone else wants to try out something like this for themselves.

When I first wanted to do something like this around 2019, I was told multiples times nobody was interested in helping me. I don't want anyone to be left out. So this is my contribution.

Every line and method in this file is made inside an NPC custom module file in, and using researched programming/code from, the LSB project/group source code. All credits to engine functions and documentation to them.
